# OpenAPS Explorer Board Edison Case and Accessories

This protective case, holster, and belt clip are designed to fit the OpenAPS reference design hardware including an Explorer Board (custom printed pcb), an Intel Edison development module, and LiPo battery. These items are very compact and held securely within the enclosure but are easily removable. This case is sufficiently vented (non-powered) and designed with rounded edges and corners for maximum comfort when carried in the pocket. This design includes an integrated "power button actuator" that allows a hard power off / on without removing the internal components.

The overall outer dimensions of this protective case without holster or belt clip are: 44mm x 24mm x 72mm. This protective case is designed to carry in a pocket. Print and attach the optional removable holster or clip to wear on the belt.

I am unaware of any real-world prints of the following holster or clip. Please let me know if you print. I am, of course, interested in the fit and finish...I am ALWAYS open to revisions...
