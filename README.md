# OpenAPS-Explorer-Board-Edison-vented-case

The contents of the enclosure will include an Explorer Board (custom printed pcb), an Intel Edison development module, and a LiPo battery. These items will be very compact and must be held securely within the enclosure but also be easily removable. This case should be sufficiently vented (non-powered) and have rounded edges and corners to ensure maximum comfort when carried in the pocket. The overall outer dimensions of the case should remain as small as possible.
