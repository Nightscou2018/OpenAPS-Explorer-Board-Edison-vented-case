# OpenAPS Explorer Board Edison Case and Accessories

This protective case, holster, and belt clip are designed to fit the OpenAPS reference design hardware including an Explorer Board (custom printed pcb), an Intel Edison development module, and a LiPo battery. These items will be very compact and must be held securely within the enclosure but also be easily removable. This case should be sufficiently vented (non-powered) and have rounded edges and corners to ensure maximum comfort when carried in the pocket. The overall outer dimensions of the case should remain as small as possible.

The case is designed to carry in a pocket. Print and attach the removable holster or clip to wear on the belt.
